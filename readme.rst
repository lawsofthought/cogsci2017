The LaTeX source (and rendered pdf) for the paper, and the Rmarkdown source
(and rendered pdf) of the slides, presented at the 39th Annual Meeting of the
Cognitive Science Society, held in London, UK on Friday July 28th.

The paper is about a Bayesian model for memory of spoken and written language.

Notes
-----

- The results presented in the slides are based on updated versions of the analysis presented in the paper. Details differ but the main conclusions of the analyses do not.
- All raw data from the experiment and all source for the computational models and the analysis of the behavioural data can be found here `here <https://github.com/lawsofthought/gallium>`_.
- To make the slides final pdf, I had to manually put together the TeX file generated by knitr from the Rmarkdown and some other TeX files. This was necessary because I could not get RMarkdown to create what the LaTeX code did.
